# NLP-PROJECT
# Tweet Similarity Analysis with Transformer Embeddings
## Overview
This project aims to develop a model for analyzing the semantic similarity between pairs of tweets and providing a similarity score indicating the likelihood that they originated from the same user. Leveraging transformer-based architectures for text representation, the model utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to discern subtle semantic nuances present in tweet content.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following components:

Data Preparation: Random sampling of tweet pairs and labeling them based on user similarity.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing tweet text for model input.
Model Architecture: Utilization of a pre-trained transformer model for sequence classification.
## Evaluation: 
Assessment of model performance using standard evaluation metrics.

## Requirements
+ Python 3.x
+ Pandas
+ NumPy
+ Transformers library (Hugging Face)
+ TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the backend of the transformer model)
+ scikit-learn
+ nltk
+ BeautifulSoup (for HTML tag removal)
  
## Usage
### Data Preparation: 
Ensure the availability of tweet data in the required format (e.g., Excel files) and execute the create_tweet_pairs function to generate tweet pairs with appropriate labels.
### Data Preprocessing: 
Clean and preprocess tweet text using the provided functions for lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, and HTML tag removal.
### Model Training: Train the model using the provided script, specifying the desired transformer model and training parameters.
### Evaluation: 
Evaluate the trained model using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Model Deployment
For deploying the trained model:

Save the trained model using appropriate serialization techniques (e.g., Trainer.save_model() or joblib.dump()).
Consider deployment strategies such as REST API integration or model serving platforms for real-time inference.
### Additional Notes
Experiment with different transformer architectures and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Explore techniques for model optimization and compression to reduce inference latency and resource consumption.
